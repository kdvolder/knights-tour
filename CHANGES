## v0.0.3 (2022-06-11)

Convert 'limit' parameter in Searchspace.breadth_search to
an optional, labeled argumented.

Remove the 'withUndo' operator from Searchspace because it
is hard to support properly and hard to use properly without
introducing bugs in a searchspace definition (hard to contain
side-effects).

Add a 'breadth_first' searchspace exploration algorithm that
gradually regresses back to dept-first search to limit memory
usage.

Add a human readable/editable texttual de/serialization format
for specifying polymonio puzzles. 

Add hexo_solve executable which solves an instance of Hexominos.

Make graphical drawing of polyomino board more pleasing to the eye:
- each piece has a different color.
- borders around the pieces to make them stand out more.

Add some randomization to the Hexo puzzle solver to make it more
interesting. It still does a 'complete' search however by
randomizing the order in which puzzle pieces and variants are
tried it will find different solutions on each run. Randomizations
also more often than not find a solution much faster than the
default ordering.

## v0.0.2 (2022-05-22)

Exploration of solving a different type of puzzle (i.e. Pentominos).
Added some extra convenience methods into the SearchEngine module.
Improved the docs.

## v0.0.1 (2022-05-8)

Initial release. A simple program that solves the Knight's Tour puzzle.
Includes a library for defining searchspaces abstractly and then searching 
them for solutions.

Compares two different implementations of the knights-tour solver.
- one uses the searchpace library.
- the other is a more direct implementation.
